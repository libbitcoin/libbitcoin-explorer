**About Libbitcoin**

The libbitcoin toolkit is a set of cross platform C++ libraries for building bitcoin applications. The toolkit consists of several libraries, most of which depend on the foundational [libbitcoin](https://github.com/libbitcoin/libbitcoin) library. Each library's repository can be cloned and built using common [Automake](http://www.gnu.org/software/automake) instructions.

**About Libbitcoin Explorer**

BX is a command line tool for working with Bitcoin. It can be built as a single portable executable for Linux, macOS or Windows and is available for download as a signed single executable for each. BX exposes over 80 commands and supports network communication with [libbitcoin-server](https://github.com/libbitcoin/libbitcoin-server) or its predecessor [Obelisk](https://github.com/spesmilo/obelisk), and the P2P Bitcoin network. BX is well documented and supports simple and advanced scenarios, including stealth and multisig.

## Installation

BX can be built from sources or downloaded as a signed portable [single file executable](https://github.com/libbitcoin/libbitcoin-explorer/wiki/Download-BX).

On Linux and Macintosh BX is built using Autotools as follows and depends on [libbitcoin-client](https://github.com/libbitcoin/libbitcoin-client).

```sh
$ ./autogen.sh
$ ./configure
$ make
$ sudo make install # optional
$ sudo ldconfig     # optional
```

> Running the above commands will install v4, which is still in active development. Using the install.sh script as described below is currently the recommended way to install BX on Linux or MacOS.

Detailed instructions are provided below.
* [Debian/Ubuntu](#debianubuntu)
* [Macintosh](#macintosh)
* [Windows](#windows)

### Debian/Ubuntu

Libbitcoin requires a C++11 compiler, currently minimum [GCC 4.8.0](https://gcc.gnu.org/projects/cxx0x.html) or Clang based on [LLVM 3.5](http://llvm.org/releases/3.5.0/docs/ReleaseNotes.html).

To see your GCC version:
```sh
$ g++ --version
```
```
g++ (Ubuntu 4.8.2-19ubuntu1) 4.8.2
Copyright (C) 2013 Free Software Foundation, Inc.
This is free software; see the source for copying conditions.  There is NO
warranty; not even for MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.
```
If necessary, upgrade your compiler as follows:
```sh
$ sudo apt-get install g++-4.8
$ sudo update-alternatives --install /usr/bin/g++ g++ /usr/bin/g++-4.8 50
$ sudo update-alternatives --install /usr/bin/gcc gcc /usr/bin/gcc-4.8 50
$ sudo update-alternatives --install /usr/bin/gcov gcov /usr/bin/gcov-4.8 50
```
Next install the [build system](http://wikipedia.org/wiki/GNU_build_system) and git:
```sh
$ sudo apt-get install build-essential autoconf automake libtool pkg-config git
```
Next install the [Boost](http://www.boost.org) (1.57.0 or newer) development package:
```sh
$ sudo apt-get install libboost-all-dev
```
Next install the [ZeroMQ](http://www.zeromq.org) (4.2.0 or newer) development package.
```sh
$ sudo apt-get install libzmq5
```
If no satisfying libzmq5 package exists in your chosen environment, the compilation can be performed with the following instructions:
```sh
$ mkdir build-zeromq-4.2.0
$ pushd build-zeromq-4.2.0
$ wget https://github.com/zeromq/libzmq/releases/download/v4.2.0/zeromq-4.2.0.tar.gz
$ tar --extract --file zeromq-4.2.0.tar.gz --gz --strip-components=1
$ ./autogen.sh
$ ./configure
$ make
$ sudo make install
$ sudo ldconfig
$ popd
```
Next download the [install script](https://github.com/libbitcoin/libbitcoin-explorer/blob/version3/install.sh) and enable execution:
```sh
$ wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/libbitcoin/libbitcoin-explorer/version3/install.sh
$ chmod +x install.sh
```
Finally install BX with default [build options](#build-notes-for-linux--macos):
```sh
$ sudo ./install.sh
```
Bitcoin Explorer is now installed in `/usr/local/bin` and can be invoked as `$ bx`.

### Macintosh

The macOS installation differs from Linux in the installation of the compiler and packaged dependencies. BX supports both [Homebrew](http://brew.sh) and [MacPorts](https://www.macports.org) package managers. Both require Apple's [Xcode](https://developer.apple.com/xcode) command line tools. Neither requires Xcode as the tools may be installed independently.

BX compiles with Clang on macOS and requires C++11 support. Installation has been verified using Clang based on [LLVM 3.5](http://llvm.org/releases/3.5.0/docs/ReleaseNotes.html). This version or newer should be installed as part of the Xcode command line tools.

To see your Clang/LLVM  version:
```sh
$ clang++ --version
```
You may encounter a prompt to install the Xcode command line developer tools, in which case accept the prompt.
```
Apple LLVM version 6.0 (clang-600.0.54) (based on LLVM 3.5svn)
Target: x86_64-apple-darwin14.0.0
Thread model: posix
```
If required update your version of the command line tools as follows:
```sh
$ xcode-select --install
```

#### Using Homebrew

First install [Homebrew](https://brew.sh).
```sh
$ ruby -e "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install)"
```
Next install the [build system](http://wikipedia.org/wiki/GNU_build_system) and [wget](http://www.gnu.org/software/wget):
```sh
$ brew install autoconf automake libtool pkgconfig wget
```
Next install the [Boost](http://www.boost.org) (1.57.0 or newer) development package:
```sh
$ brew install boost
```
Next install the [ZeroMQ](http://www.zeromq.org) (4.2.0 or newer) development package:
```sh
$ brew install zeromq
```
Next download the [install script](https://github.com/libbitcoin/libbitcoin-explorer/blob/version3/install.sh) and enable execution:
```sh
$ wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/libbitcoin/libbitcoin-explorer/version3/install.sh
$ chmod +x install.sh
```
Finally install BX with default [build options](#build-notes-for-linux--macos):
```sh
$ ./install.sh
```
Bitcoin Explorer is now installed in `/usr/local/bin` and can be invoked as `$ bx`.

##### Installing from Formula

Instead of building, Bitcoin Explorer can be installed from a formula:
```sh
$ brew install libbitcoin-explorer
```
or
```sh
$ brew install bx
```

#### Using MacPorts

First install [MacPorts](https://www.macports.org/install.php).

Next install the [build system](http://wikipedia.org/wiki/GNU_build_system) and [wget](http://www.gnu.org/software/wget):
```sh
$ sudo port install autoconf automake libtool pkgconfig wget
```
Next install the [Boost](http://www.boost.org) (1.57.0 or newer) development package. The `-` options remove MacPort defaults that are not Boost defaults:
```sh
$ sudo port install boost -no_single -no_static -python27
```
Next install the [ZeroMQ](http://www.zeromq.org) (4.2.0 or newer) development package. This package does not appear to be available via MacPorts, and so follows compilation instructions:
```sh
$ mkdir build-zeromq-4.2.0
$ pushd build-zeromq-4.2.0
$ wget https://github.com/zeromq/libzmq/releases/download/v4.2.0/zeromq-4.2.0.tar.gz
$ tar --extract --file zeromq-4.2.0.tar.gz --gz --strip-components=1
$ ./autogen.sh
$ ./configure
$ make
$ sudo make install
$ popd
```
Next download the [install script](https://github.com/libbitcoin/libbitcoin-explorer/blob/version3/install.sh) and enable execution:
```sh
$ wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/libbitcoin/libbitcoin-explorer/version3/install.sh
$ chmod +x install.sh
```
Finally install BX with default [build options](#build-notes-for-linux--macos):
```sh
$ ./install.sh
```
Bitcoin Explorer is now installed in `/usr/local/bin` and can be invoked as `$ bx`.

### Build Notes for Linux / macOS

Any set of `./configure` options can be passed via the build script, several examples follow.

Building for minimum size and with debug symbols stripped:
```sh
$ sudo ./install.sh CXXFLAGS="-Os -s"
```

> The `-s` option is not supported by the Clang compiler. Instead use the command `$ strip bs` after the build.

Building without NDEBUG (i.e. with debug assertions) defined:
```sh
$ sudo ./install.sh --disable-ndebug
```
Building without building tests:
```sh
$ sudo ./install.sh --without-tests
```
Building from a specified directory, such as `/home/me/mybuild`:
```sh
$ sudo ./install.sh --build-dir=/home/me/mybuild
```
Building into a directory other than `/usr/local`, such as `/home/me/myprefix`:
```sh
$ ./install.sh --prefix=/home/me/myprefix
```
Building and linking with a private copy of the Boost dependency:
```sh
$ ./install.sh --build-boost --prefix=/home/me/myprefix
```
Building and linking with a private copy of the ZeroMQ dependency:
```sh
$ ./install.sh --build-zmq --prefix=/home/me/myprefix
```

Building a statically-linked executable:
```sh
$ ./install.sh --disable-shared --build-boost --build-zmq --prefix=/home/me/myprefix
```
Building a small statically-linked executable most quickly:
```sh
$ ./install.sh CXXFLAGS="-Os -s" --without-tests --disable-shared --build-boost --build-zmq --prefix=/home/me/myprefix
```
Building with bash-completion support:

> If your target system does not have it pre-installed you must first install the [bash-completion](http://bash-completion.alioth.debian.org) package. Packages are available for common package managers, including apt-get, homebrew and macports.

```sh
$ sudo ./install.sh --with-bash-completion-dir
```

#### Compiling with ICU (International Components for Unicode)

Since the addition of [BIP-39](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0039.mediawiki) and later [BIP-38](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0038.mediawiki) support, libbitcoin conditionally incorporates [ICU](http://site.icu-project.org). To use the BIP-38 and BIP-39 passphrase normalization features libbitcoin must be compiled with the `--with-icu` option.
```sh
$ ./install.sh --with-icu
```

#### Compiling with QR Code Support

Since the addition of [qrcode](https://github.com/evoskuil/libbitcoin/blob/master/src/wallet/qrcode.cpp) support, libbitcoin conditionally incorporates `qrencode`. This requires compiling with the `--with-qrencode` option.
```sh
$ ./install.sh --with-qrencode
```

Since the addition of [png](https://github.com/evoskuil/libbitcoin/blob/master/src/utility/png.cpp) support, libbitcoin conditionally incorporates `libpng` (which in turn requires `zlib`). This requires compiling with the `--with-png` option.
```sh
$ ./install.sh --with-png
```

> There is a bug in the PNG library when using space optimization levels such as `CXXFLAGS=-Os` which will show up in a test run failure.

#### Building ICU, ZLib, PNG, QREncode ZeroMQ and/or Boost

The installer can download and install any or all of these dependencies. ICU is a large package that is not typically preinstalled at a sufficient level. Using these builds ensures compiler and configuration compatibility across all of the build components. It is recommended to use a prefix directory when building these components.
```sh
$ ./install.sh --with-icu --with-png --with-qrencode --build-icu --build-zlib --build-png --build-qrencode --build-boost --build-zmq --prefix=/home/me/myprefix
```

### Windows

Visual Studio solutions are maintained for all libbitcoin libraries and dependencies. See the [libbitcoin](https://github.com/libbitcoin/libbitcoin/blob/master/README.md#windows) repository general information about building the Visual Studio solutions. To build Libbitcoin Explorer you must also download and build its **libbitcoin dependencies**, as these are not yet packaged.

Build these solutions in order:

1. [libbitcoin/libbitcoin](https://github.com/libbitcoin/libbitcoin)
2. [libbitcoin/libbitcoin-protocol](https://github.com/libbitcoin/libbitcoin-protocol)
3. [libbitcoin/libbitcoin-client](https://github.com/libbitcoin/libbitcoin-client)
4. [libbitcoin/libbitcoin-explorer](https://github.com/libbitcoin/libbitcoin-explorer)
